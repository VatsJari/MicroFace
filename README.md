The implantation of flexible neural probes leads to a type traumatic brain injury (TBI), which triggers neuroinflammation and impacts the performance of the probe. Microglia, as the resident immune cells of the brain, plays a crucial role in initiating and maintaining neuroinflammation. Upon activation, microglia undergo morphological changes, transitioning from a resting, highly ramified state to a more ameboid shape, indicating specific functions in neuroinflammation. In addition, microglia can exhibit intermediate forms of morphology between ameboid and ramified states, and their morphology and function can vary as they undergo processes such as migration, phagocytosis, and extension or retraction of processes. This variability and crossover between states can be difficult to measure using traditional methods as they can be labor-intensive and error-prone, but automated image analysis can be used to quantitate these details. 
To address these issues, we developed an automated image analysis method using the Iba1 immuno-stained images of microglia from a TBI rat model implanted with flexible neural probes. In general, the methodology involved several distinct stages, including pre-processing, illumination correction, skeleton reconstruction, and data clustering. The technique enabled the analysis of microglia morphology from microscopy images and provided up to 79 morphological parameters for more than 400.000 microglia. 
The spatiotemporal distribution of cell counts revealed an increase in the density of microglia cells after an acute injury during 1-, 2-, and 8- weeks post-implantation (WPI), suggesting the proliferation of microglia towards the site of injury. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that at 2 WPI, the morphology parameters of microglia cells located near and far from the injury site were 95% similar, indicating a state of homeostasis. However, this homeostatic phase was disrupted again at 8- and 18-WPI which might be an indication of chronic inflammation. The individual microglia cells underwent principal component analysis (PCA) which resulted in the identification of 14 different morpho-types that were grouped into 4 major phenotypes - ameboid, highly ramified, transition, and rod-like microglia. The frequency occurrence of these phenotypes showed that there were 3 zones of spatial distribution in perspective of TBI - activated, intermediate, and homeostatic zone.
In conclusion, our classification of microglial morphological phenotypes using the automated tool can serve as a time-saving and objective method for the characterization of microglial changes in the TBI rat model, and might also represent a useful tool for human brain samples. Moreover, the tool is not limited to microglia and can be applied to a variety of cell types.
